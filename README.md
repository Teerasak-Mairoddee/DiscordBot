# DiscordBot
A chat bot that helps users pull coin prices to help them make quick market descisions on the go.

# Features
1) Use commands to ask the bot for a coin price
2) Uses APIs and cross checks our spreadsheet to match our keys against the API site coins.
3) Information returned includes an emoji to indicate if the coin has went up or down.
4) Will reply comically if it doesn't recognise a commad
5) Uses Google sheets so that non-coders can customise and add keys

# Why?
As a part of investment, my room mate is required do lots of research before making a financial decision.
This requires logging into a crypto site and scouring the web for any key events or info that may be key to the performance of the price.
I wanted to make a bot so that we could all request prices quickly and effortlessly on a platform with like minded people to then add input into
the discord chat. By using discord we can notify the groupchat collectivly and collaborate on ideas and research.
